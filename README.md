This is an experimental fork, with small changes to allow more elaborate use of the endpoint ViewPageJs (URL shape: `/view/{urn}/{count}/json`). Specifically, I create a simply formatted table of the most similar documents, sorted by work and rank, with the help of [this additional Python script](https://github.com/tylergneill/pramana-nlp/blob/master/4_lda_topic_modeling/4.6_doc_similarity_table/format_doc_similarity_table.py). I also open up the possibility of outputting the full passage text via JSON for the sake of a further developed such summary view (e.g., HTML with tooltips).
